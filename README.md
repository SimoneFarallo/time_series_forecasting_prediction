# time_series_forecasting_prediction
Time series forecasting plays an essential role in an increasingly data-driven world, enabling anticipation of future events based on historical data, making more accurate decisions, and identifying trends and patterns in data. In the specific context of electricity consumption, forecasting plays a crucial role in providing information to energy providers to improve the performance of their systems in terms of productivity and efficiency. The goal of this project is to analyze the trend of electricity consumption and compare three different forecasting approaches: ARIMA, UCM, and Machine Learning. The available data is a univariate time series related to electricity consumption in the city of TÃ©touan, Morocco, in 2017. The results of the three forecasting methods are compared using Mean Absolute Error as the reference metric. Through the analysis of the results, it will be possible to determine which of the three approaches best suits the electricity consumption forecast for the period from December 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017.
